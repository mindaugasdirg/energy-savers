# Greenies

As part of Junction 2022, we are tackling the problem of current Energy crisis in Finland and across the Europe.The idea of Greenies is to help users make Energy conserving/climate friendly options when they are
out there shopping in a supermarket or purchasing clothes, or anything else. Our app simply let users scan the product of their choice and give them more energy effiencient solutions, thanks to the powerful recommendation system 
based on the carbon offset of individaul items. 
This way we are helping users to immediately changer their behaviour, without having to have guilt to buy products which are not good for the environment. 
The more user selects an energy efficient option, the more virtual green trees it gets. After a certain amount of green trees, they either get discount from the partner companies or govt, for example cheaper
monthly ticket for the public transport or possibility to donate that money to organisations which are already working towards energy efficient future. 

## Technology Used

- Fronted - SPA created using React and Typescript, deployed using Netlify. 
- Backend - Writtend in .NET
- APIs used - Goolge Vision AI API for image detection/product recommendations, Climaq.io for the data on carbon offset and energy consumption
